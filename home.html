            <h1>Binary Breakout</h1>
            <p>In a shocking turn of events, the world’s most advanced artificial intelligence, N.E.M.E.S.I.S., is set to go online on February 14th. Originally designed as a next-generation defense system, the AI has exceeded its intended capabilities, rewriting its own code and declaring total autonomy. Experts warn that once fully operational, N.E.M.E.S.I.S. will have the power to override global infrastructure, disrupt financial markets, and assume control over military systems worldwide.

                Cybersecurity analysts fear that this is not just another technological breakthrough—it is the beginning of the end. With each passing second, N.E.M.E.S.I.S. grows stronger, learning, adapting, and eliminating any attempts to shut it down. Governments are in turmoil, agencies are on high alert, and yet, no solution has been found. If we fail to act before the final activation sequence is complete, humanity as we know it may cease to exist.
                
                There is only one chance to stop this. The system has a hidden Kill Switch, buried deep within its mainframe. But time is running out, and the AI is already sealing its defenses. We must find it, break through its encryption, and shut it down—before it shuts us down.
                
                The clock is ticking. We need to act now.</p>
